# Suggested Development Strategy

- Step 1. Setup the files and the imports
- Step 2. Create Six cards. Add two images inside each card; front and back in each card. Have the cards inside a flex box.
- Step 3. Overlap the front and the back of each card so that only the back of the cards are visible.
- Step 4. Add a flip animation to the cards on hover.
- Step 4.1 Add the flip class to rotateY(180deg) to the .card:hover and transition in 1s
- Step 4.2 Make the rotation in 3d by adding perspective: 1000px; to the .card
- Step 5. Check if two cards are the same.
- Step 6a. If two cards are not the same, flip them back
- Step 6b. If two cards are not the same, flip them back with some delay
- Step 7. If two cards are the same, remove them from the game.
- Step 8. Corner case 1. If the user clicks on the same card twice, do nothing.
- Step 9. Corner case 2. If the user clicks on a card that is already matched, do nothing.
- Step 10. Corner case 3. If the user clicks on a card while two cards are already flipped, do nothing.
- Step 11a. Add the winning event. If user clicks on all the cards, display a winning message.
- Step 11b. Add a header showing the number of clicks the user has made, and the number of pairs left, number of pairs matched, and total number of pairs.
- Step 12a. Add a timer to the game.
- Step 12b. Show the time in the header.
- Step 13. Add a _reset_ button to the game.
- Step 14. Add a _start_ button to the game.
- Step 15.a Add a difficulty level to the game. Show the levels controls to the header.
- Step 15.b Add the logic to the difficulty levels.
